This repository documents our course project titled "Benchmarking Automatic Segmentation of Retinal Vascular Structure".

Initial data visualization and prepartation was performed in jupyter notebooks for the convenience of running cells.

Deep learning implementations are distinguished by pytorch (or keras).
